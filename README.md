# Agentic Code Atlas

This project automates the process of generating comprehensive documentation and visual diagrams for your codebase. By analyzing metadata such as namespaces and code structures, the tool leverages an agent-based system to produce detailed insights, including system overviews, architecture diagrams, and component breakdowns. Integrated with PlantUML, it effortlessly creates C4 model diagrams, making it a powerful resource for developers looking to understand and document complex systems.
